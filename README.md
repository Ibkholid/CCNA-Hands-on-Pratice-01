# CCNA Super Lab – Enterprise Network Design

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains my CCNA Super Lab project, designed to simulate a real-world enterprise network with redundancy, scalability, and high availability.

## 🔧 Technologies Implemented
- VLAN & Trunking
- Inter-VLAN Routing
- DHCP Server & DHCP Relay
- OSPF Multi-Area
- EtherChannel (LACP)
- Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)
- HSRP (Gateway Redundancy)
- VTP

## 🧪 Verification
Screenshots for OSPF routing, HSRP status, and EtherChannel verification are available in the `verification/` directory.

## 🎯 Purpose
This lab was created to strengthen my hands-on networking skills and prepare for real-world network engineering roles.
